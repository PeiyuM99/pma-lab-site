  <p>
    We are a geometry-driven robotics lab dedicated to turning structural principles into robots that can transform,
    reconfigure, and adapt. By leveraging mechanisms, kinematic constraints, and polyhedral architectures, we develop modular
    systems such as cube and tetrahedral robots that can change shape to overcome obstacles, squeeze through confined spaces,
    and recover from impacts. Our research spans the full stack from geometric design and modeling to control and embodied
    sensing, aiming to achieve reliable mobility and environmental awareness in unknown, complex terrain where vision or GPS
    may be limited. We explore how reconfigurable morphology can simplify decision-making, improve stability, and enable
    versatile behaviors across diverse surfaces and gaps. These capabilities support high-impact missions in extreme settings,
    including post-disaster reconnaissance and search-and-rescue operations, as well as planetary exploration in harsh,
    unstructured environments.
